<p>This is Mingjun Zou's homepage. For filling this homepage, I'll do a short self-introduction here.<br><br>
I'm doing Bachelor of Communication Design in Monash Uni. This is my third year, also the last year in Monash. I'm an international student, which means I have already been in Australia for two and a half years. <br><br>
In the area of designing, I'm mostly interested in the animation, but I'm terrible at it, so I'm hoping I can improve this skill this year. At the same time, I want to learn more about coding because I start to find it interesting. During these years, I had learned a lot about the Adobe's softwares, from knowingg nothing to easily using them. What I can use are After Effect, Photoshop, Illustrator, and In Design. I also know a bit about the other softwares like lightning.
